// Here, I have declared the variables that are presented when the user launches the application. There are permanent variables such as the OneStepQuiz title where the user cannot change this and the viewDidLoad does not call any functions to change the title//

//MMDrawerController was downloaded from https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController //
//The Side panel class was also declared here. This would be carried out when the Begin button is pressed//
